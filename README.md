#Crack Leaked Password Database and Password Policy

#Overview:

As a governance analyst it is part of your duties to assess the level of protection offered by implemented controls and minimize the probability of a successful breach. To be successful at your job you often need to know the techniques used by hackers to circumvent implemented controls and propose uplifts to increase the overall level of security in an organization. Gaining valid credentials gives the attackers access to the organizationâ€™s IT system, thus circumventing most perimeter controls in place.
